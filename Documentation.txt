N8N + LLM TEXT ANALYZER

This project is a React.js web application integrated with an n8n workflow for automated text analysis using a Large Language Model (LLM).
Users can input a paragraph and choose between Summary and Sentiment modes to analyze the text.


FEATURES

  - Two analysis modes: Summary and Sentiment
  - Real-time result rendering
  - Robust error handling and loading indicators
  - Environment variable-based URL configuration
  - Clean, minimal design without external styling frameworks


WORKFLOW DESCRIPTION

  1. The user enters text and selects the analysis mode.
  2. The React app sends a POST request with the text and mode to the n8n webhook.
  3. The n8n workflow processes the text using a conditional logic node to determine the mode.
  4. The LLM (Gemini) receives the prompt and returns the analysis result.
  5. The result is sent back through the Respond to Webhook node.
  6. The React frontend displays the analysis result neatly on the screen.


TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES

  - React.js: Frontend development framework.
  - Axios: For HTTP POST requests to the backend.
  - n8n: Automation tool connecting APIs and workflows.
  - LLM API: For text summarization and sentiment analysis.
  - Environment Variables: Used to store the webhook securely.


SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

  1. Clone the repository:
       git clone https://github.com/your-username/n8n-text-analyzer.git
       cd n8n-text-analyzer

  2. Install dependencies:
       npm install

  3. Create a .env file and add your production n8n webhook URL:
       REACT_APP_n8nLink=https://kamaleshk.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/text-analysis

  4. Run the app:
       npm start

  Access it locally at http://localhost:3000.


DEPLOYMENT NOTES

  - Add the same REACT_APP_n8nLink variable in your hosting provider's environment variables section.
  - Supported platforms: Netlify.
  - Ensure the n8n webhook is public and active.


EXAMPLE N8N WORKFLOW

  - Trigger: Webhook (POST)
  - Nodes:
      - Function node (for conditional logic)
      - LLM (e.g., OpenAI node for summary/sentiment generation)
      - Respond to Webhook (returns { analysis: "..." })


ARCHITECTURE SUMMARY

  FRONTEND (React):
    - Handles text input, mode selection, and result display.
    - Communicates with the backend using Axios.

  BACKEND (n8n Workflow):
    - Processes input text.
    - Integrates LLM for text processing.
    - Sends formatted response back.


DEVELOPER DOCUMENTATION

Overview:
  The n8n + LLM Text Analyzer demonstrates seamless integration between frontend and workflow automation.
  It provides a lightweight, efficient way to automate AI-based text interpretation directly from a web interface.

Setup Workflow in n8n:
  1. Create a Webhook Trigger node (POST method).
  2. Add a Switch or IF node to branch logic by mode value.
  3. Connect each branch to an LLM Node (e.g., OpenAI, Gemini, or Claude) with mode-specific prompts.
  4. Merge the outputs and send the final text via Respond to Webhook.

Key Environment Variable:
  - REACT_APP_n8nLink: The webhook URL endpoint of your n8n workflow

TROUBLESHOOTING

  Issue: Cannot POST /undefined
    Cause: .env not loaded
    Solution: Restart the server or check the variable name.

  Issue: No response from workflow
    Cause: n8n webhook inactive or incorrect URL
    Solution: Activate workflow and verify endpoint.

  Issue: Timeout
    Cause: n8n server slow or blocked
    Solution: Increase timeout in Axios or optimize workflow.
